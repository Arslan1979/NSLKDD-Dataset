# NSLKDD-Dataset
NSL-KDD Dataset for WEKA - feel free to download

Original dataset with slight modification to include attack categories e.g. DOS, U2R as done with the original Kdd99 dataset.
Attack types in the new field xAttack and use real-values.

Attacks assigned with real values in new field called xAttack:

dos = [1]

u2r = [2]

r2l = [3]

probe = [4]

normal = [5]

unknown = [6]

The dataset has also been coded, the following fields' flag, service and protocol_type categories now represents numerical values instead of categorical.
